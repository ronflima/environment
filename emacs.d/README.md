# My Emacs Customizations

My customizations can be customized, although it may sound
funny. Place a `customizations.el` file in this directory and add your
customizations in there. This file is called after my configuration is
done, which means that any customization you may do will overwrite
mine.

The file `customizations.el`is ignored by git and it is considered
local to your environment. So, if you intend to save it, edit your
local `.gitignore` to include it as well.
